# Aviation Lower-Risks
## Project goal
To determine the Aircraft with the lowest risk
## Data source and Data Exploration
The dataset comes from kaggle.com which provides details about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United states and international waters
The dataset is from the National Transportation Safety Board(NTSB)
The dataset had 31columns which include:
   -Investigation type
   -Aircraft damage and category
   -Number of engines and their types
   -weather conditions of the event date
## Business Overview
For this project we will use data cleaning,imputation,analysis and visualization to generate insight for the business stakeholder
## Business Understanding
Company is expanding into new industries of aircrafts. They are determined to know the aircraft with the lowest risks for the company to start this new business endeavor. The company knows nothing about the potential risks of aircraft.
## Data Understanding
The dataset we have is from the National Transportation Safety Board(NTSB) that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
## Objectives
To determine the aircraft with the lowest-risks ​

To determine which location has  the lowest-risks​

To determine which engine type was least risky​

To determine the model with few accidents​

 ## Conclusion
 Aircraft model 340 and RV-7A have the lowest number of accident​

Aircraft were substantially damage ​

The engine type which is mostly used is reciprocating​

The helicopter category had the Lowest number of injuries and also being the aircraft with lower risk
## Recomendation
I would recommend on the helicopter aircraft because they can be used in the private transportation and a few airplane for the public transportation
